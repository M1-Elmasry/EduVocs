            EduVocs is a revolutionary cross-platform application designed to
            transform language learning by redefining the way users master
            vocabulary. The app, currently in its MVP stage, offers real-time
            learning experiences and eliminates traditional methods like
            transcribing words onto paper. It features a floating widget for
            easy accessibility and two sections for knowing and learning
            vocabularies. The future plans include additional features such as
            story and article generation based on collected words, along with
            the ability for users to take exams on their vocabulary. The
            application is portrayed as a helping tool, a memorization ship for
            new words, and a valuable resource in the language-learning journey.
